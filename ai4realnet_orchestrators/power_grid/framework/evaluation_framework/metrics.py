        """
        Computes KPI-RF-078 (reward per action) for a single episode.

        WHAT COUNTS AS AN ACTION
        ------------------------
        A step counts as an action when the agent returned anything other than the
        environment's do-nothing action, i.e. `(act != do_nothing_action).any()`. This is
        the same rule already used for the `n_steps_with_act` column, reused deliberately
        so the two columns stay consistent.

        This matters because the defender is gated: `my_agent.act_with_id()` only consults
        the policy once `observation.rho.max()` reaches `best_action_threshold`. Below that
        it returns a default action, so actions are a small fraction of steps and
        `ave_reward_per_step` mostly tracks episode length rather than the value of each
        intervention.

        TOPOLOGY-RECOVERY ACTIONS ARE COUNTED
        -------------------------------------
        In the safe branch the agent still emits `revert_topo(...)` (when `self.topo` is
        set) and `find_best_line_to_reconnect(...)`. Both are non-do-nothing actions and so
        are counted here. That is deliberate: they are real interventions on the grid with
        real operational cost, and excluding them would flatter an agent that churns the
        topology while idle.

        Because that choice is arguable, `n_actions_excl_recovery` is emitted alongside.
        It requires a `recovery_action_fn` predicate to be supplied to the constructor --
        classifying a recovery action needs the grid2op action space, which this module
        deliberately does not depend on. Without it the column is NaN, never a wrong number.

        NaN HANDLING
        ------------
        Steps whose reward is NaN are dropped from BOTH the reward sum and the action
        count, so numerator and denominator always cover exactly the same steps. An episode
        with zero actions yields NaN (not 0 and not a division error) -- "no interventions"
        is undefined for a per-action average, not zero value per action.

            actions (list): Actions taken in the episode, as vectors.
            rewards (list): Per-step rewards for the same episode.
